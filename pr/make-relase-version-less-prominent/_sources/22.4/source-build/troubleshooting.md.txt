## Troubleshooting

This page contains hints for troubleshooting source build specific issues.

### Failed to find port_list ‘33d0cd82-57c6-11e1-8ed1-406186ea4fc5‘

This error can occur when tying to use the Task Wizard to create a quick scan
after the initial setup. It is cause by {command}`gvmd` not being able to load
the port lists from the {term}`feed` into its database. To fix this issue, you
need to check if {file}`/var/lib/gvm/data-objects/` contains the port list XML
file:

```{code-block} shell
---
caption: Checking if port list is already synced
---
find /var/lib/gvm/data-objects/ -name "*33d0cd82-57c6-11e1-8ed1-406186ea4fc5*.xml"
```

If the {command}`find` command does not return an XML file, the data objects
have not been synced from the {term}`feed` (yet).

```{code-block} shell
---
caption: Syncing data objects processed by gvmd
---
sudo -u gvm greenbone-feed-sync --type GVMD_DATA
```

Second, {command}`gvmd` should be forced to (re-)load the data objects including
the port lists from the disk.

```{code-block} shell
---
caption: Syncing data objects processed by gvmd
---
sudo -u gvm gvmd --rebuild-gvmd-data=all
```

When {command}`gvmd` has loaded the port list successfully the {file}`/var/log/gvm/gvmd.log`
file shows the following output

```{code-block} none
:caption: gvmd port list loaded log message

Port list All IANA assigned TCP (33d0cd82-57c6-11e1-8ed1-406186ea4fc5) has been created by admin
```

### Failed to find scan configuration

This issue is similar to [Failed to find port_list](#failed-to-find-port_list-33d0cd82-57c6-11e1-8ed1-406186ea4fc5).
It will be raised if {command}`gvmd` is not able to load the scan configs from
the file system into its database. First of all you should check if the scan
configs have been downloaded from the {term}`feed`.

```{code-block} shell
---
caption: Checking if scan configs are already available
---
find /var/lib/gvm/data-objects/ -name "*daba56c8-73ec-11df-a475-002264764cea*.xml"
```

If the {command}`find` command does not return at least one XML file for your
release, the data objects have not been downloaded from the {term}`feed` (yet).

```{code-block} shell
---
caption: Syncing data objects processed by gvmd
---
sudo -u gvm greenbone-feed-sync --type gvmd-data
```

Because scan configs reference {term}`VTs<VT>`, loading scan configs also
requires synced VTs from the {term}`feed`. You can check if the VTs are already
loaded by looking at the {menuselection}`Secinfo > NVTs` page on the web interface.

If there are no VTs visible on the web interface, they must be downloaded from the
feed.

```{code-block} shell
---
caption: Syncing VTs processed by the openvas scanner
---
sudo -u gvm greenbone-feed-sync --type nvt
```

Loading the VTs from the file system may take a while, from several minutes up
to hours depending on your system performance and number of {term}`VTs<VT>`. You
can follow the process of loading VTs by looking at the {file}`/var/log/gvm/ospd-openvas.log`
and {file}`/var/log/gvm/gvmd.log` files.

If there are still no scan configs under {menuselection}`Configuration > Scan Configs`
on the web interface after some hours and the logs of gvmd and ospd-openvas do not show
errors, the `Feed Import Owner` may not have been set.


```{code-block} shell
---
caption: Setting the `Feed Import Owner`
---
gvmd --modify-setting 78eceaec-3385-11ea-b237-28d24461215b --value `gvmd --get-users --verbose | grep admin | awk '{print $2}'`
```

If all these steps do not resolve the issue, it is very likely a bigger problem,
for example with the PostgreSQL database. Therefore, the
{file}`/var/log/gvm/ospd-openvas.log` and {file}`/var/log/gvm/gvmd.log` files
must be inspected for possible error and warning messages.
