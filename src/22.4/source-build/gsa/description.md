The web application is written in JavaScript and relies on the
[react framework](https://reactjs.org/). It uses [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
for building the application and maintaining the JavaScript dependencies.
Because the installation of a specific nodejs version requires a setup of
external package repositories and the build process takes a lot of time,
pre-built distributable files are available. These pre-built distributable files
are used in this docs.
