The web application is written in JavaScript and uses the
[react framework](https://reactjs.org/). It requires
[nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) for building the application and *yarn* (or *npm*)
for maintaining the JavaScript dependencies. Because the installation of yarn
and the specific nodejs version requires a setup of external package
repositories and a long build time, pre-built distributable files are available
and used in this docs.
