The web application is written in JavaScript and relies on the
[react framework](https://reactjs.org/). It uses [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
for building the application and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
for maintaining the JavaScript dependencies. Because the installation of yarn
and the specific nodejs version requires a setup of external package
repositories and the build process takes a lot of time, pre-built distributable
files are available. These pre-built distributable files are used in this docs.
