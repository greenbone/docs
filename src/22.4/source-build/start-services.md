### Starting the Greenbone Community Edition Services

```{important}
When the feed content has been downloaded, the new data must be loaded by
the corresponding daemons. This may take several minutes up to hours, especially
for the initial loading of the data. Without loaded data, scans will contain
incomplete and erroneous results.
```

After starting the Greenbone Community Edition services via systemd, the running
daemons will pick up the feed content and load the data automatically.

```{warning}
Please be aware, even if the {command}`systemctl start` commands are returning
immediately, the **first startup** of the services may take several minutes
or even hours!
```
