Architecture
============

The Greenbone Community Edition consists of a framework with several services.
It is developed as part of the commercial `Greenbone Enterprise`_ product line .

The Greenbone Community Edition was originally built as a community project
named `OpenVAS`_ and is primarily developed and forwarded by Greenbone Networks.

The following figure shows an overview of the architecture for the 21.04 release.

  Architecture in release 21.04

The architecture for the version 21.04 is grouped into three major parts:

* Executable scan application that runs vulnerability tests (VT) against target
  systems
* Greenbone Vulnerability Manager Daemon (gvmd)
* Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) with the Greenbone Security Assistant
  Daemon (gsad)

The Greenbone Community Edition is released under open-source licenses. By using
it, Linux distributions can create and provide the software components in the
form of installation packages.

Greenbone Vulnerability Manager Daemon (gvmd)
---------------------------------------------

The `Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (gvmd)`_ is the central service that
consolidates plain vulnerability scanning into a full vulnerability management
solution. gvmd controls the OpenVAS Scanner via Open Scanner Protocol (OSP).

The service itself offers the XML-based, stateless
:term:`Greenbone Management Protocol (GMP)<GMP>`. gvmd also controls an SQL
database (PostgreSQL) where all configuration and scan result data is centrally
stored. Furthermore, gvmd also handles user management including permissions
control with groups and roles. And finally, the service has an internal runtime
system for scheduled tasks and other events.

Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA)
----------------------------------

The `Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA)`_ is the web interface that a
user controls scans and accesses vulnerability information with. It is the main
contact point for a user. It connects to gvmd via the web server `Greenbone
Security Assistant Daemon (gsad)`_ to provide a full-featured web application for
vulnerability management. The communication occurs using the
:term:`Greenbone Management Protocol (GMP)<GMP>` with which the user can also
communicate directly by using different tools.

OpenVAS Scanner
---------------

The main scanner `OpenVAS Scanner`_ is a full-featured scan engine that executes
vulnerability tests (VTs) against target systems. For this, it uses the daily
updated and comprehensive feeds: the full-featured, extensive, commercial
:term:`Greenbone Enterprise Feed <Greenbone Enterprise Feed>` or the free
available :term:`Greenbone Community Feed <Greenbone Community Feed>`.

The scanner consists of the components `ospd-openvas`_ and `openvas-scanner`_.
The OpenVAS Scanner is controlled via :term:`OSP`. The OSP Daemon for the
OpenVAS Scanner (ospd-openvas) communicates with gvmd via OSP: VT data is
collected, scans are started and stopped, and scan results are transferred to
gvmd via ospd.

Additional Software
-------------------

The `Greenbone Vulnerability Management Tools (gvm-tools)`_ are a collection of
tools that help with remote controlling a Greenbone Enterprise Appliance.
and its underlying Greenbone Vulnerability Manager Daemon (gvmd). The tools aid
in accessing the communication protocols
:term:`GMP (Greenbone Management Protocol)<GMP>` and
:term:`OSP (Open Scanner Protocol)<OSP>`.

This module is comprised of interactive and non-interactive clients.
The programming language Python is supported directly for interactive scripting.
But it is also possible to issue remote GMP/OSP commands without programming in
Python.
