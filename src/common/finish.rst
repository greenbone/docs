Starting the Vulnerability Management
=====================================

After the services have started and all data has been loaded, the *Greenbone
Security Manager* web interface – GSA – can be opened in the browser.

  xdg-open "http://127.0.0.1:9392" 2>/dev/null >/dev/null &

The browser will show the login page of *GSA* and after using the credentials
created in the `Setting Up an Admin User <#setting-up-an-admin-user>`_ chapter,
it is possible to start with the vulnerability scanning.
