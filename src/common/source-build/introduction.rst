Building the Greenbone Community Edition stack from source requires knowledge
about:

* Using a terminal
* Shell programming basics
* Installing software via *apt*
* Using a C compiler
* Using *CMake* and *make*
* The `Linux File System Hierarchy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard>`_
* Running services via *systemd*

Additionally, a basic knowledge about the :doc:`architecture </architecture>`
of the Greenbone Community Edition is required to follow this guide.

.. note::

  This guide is intended for developers who want to try out the newest features
  and/or want to get familiar with the source code. It is not intended for
  production setups.

  It assumes that **Debian stable** `(bullseye) <https://www.debian.org/releases/stable>`_ is used as the
  Linux distribution. Most likely, a Debian derivate like Ubuntu and Kali will also work with
  only minor adjustments required.
