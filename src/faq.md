## Greenbone, GVM and OpenVAS â€“ How are they connected?

For a comprehensive background see {doc}`History of OpenVAS <history>`.

## Where can I ask questions and get support?

Support is only provided for the Greenbone Enterprise product line.
Besides that, the Greenbone Community can be reached at the [https://community.greenbone.net][community forum]
to ask question. In this forum, several Greenbone developers try to help on a
voluntary basis.

## Can you help with my issue on Kali, Cent OS, XYZ distribution?

[https://community.greenbone.net/t/openvas-showing-503-error/5465/4](https://community.greenbone.net/t/openvas-showing-503-error/5465/4)

Greenbone doesn't provide any packages for any Linux distribution besides the
commercial Greenbone OS. If you have installed the Greenbone Community Edition
from your distribution like Kali Linux, an external package repository
or even some random docker image, Greenbone was not involved in providing this
installation method to you.

The development of the Greenbone Community Edition and packaging for a
distribution or container image is completely independent. Therefore, our
software provided from these sources may be heavily adjusted, outdated or even
completely broken. If you have issues with the software, please contact the
provider of the packages first and create a ticket at their issue tracker. How
to contact the provider depends and varies.

We are **not** able to offer any help on updating packages from **any** external
source like Kali, Cent OS, Docker Image, .... because we are not aware of their
specific needs and changes!

## Please help me installing OpenVAS and please advise on recommended platform OS, too.

This is very similar to [Can you help with my issue on Kali, Cent OS, XYZ distribution](#can-you-help-with-my-issue-on-kali-cent-os-xyz-distribution).
Greenbone can't provide installation docs for the many available Linux
distributions available. Setups, configurations, build systems, packaging tools,
available software, best practices, ... diverge to much to offer *official*
packages, scripts or anything else from Greenbone. We offer this Greenbone Community Edition
documentation and the [community forum] for discussing setup problems. Therefore,
Greenbone also doesn't recommend any distribution nor do we prefer one
distribution over the other. Most of the time, we are not even aware which
distribution ships which version of our software.

## Which release contains which component? GOS version vs. GVM version?

It was often confusing to find out which software component of the
{term}`Greenbone Community Edition` belongs to which GVM release.
Additionally, the {term}`Greenbone OS <GOS>`
used in the [Greenbone Enterprise TRIAL Virtual Machine](https://www.greenbone.net/en/testnow/)
had a different versioning scheme then GVM. We are aware of this and 
with the 20.08 release, we changed our versioning scheme to
[Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/). With this change all software
components (besides the extra software openvas-smb, gvm-tools and python-gvm),
GVM and GOS are using the same major and minor version.

| GVM | GOS | gvmd | GMP | GSA  | gvm-libs | Scanner | Status | Release |
|:--------|-------:|---------|--------|--------:|-------------|------------|----------|------------|
| [GVM 21.04](https://community.greenbone.net/t/gvm-21-04-stable-initial-release-2021-04-16/8942) | 21.04| 21.4 | 21.4 | 21.4 | 21.4 | 21.4| stable | 2021-04-16 |
| [GVM 20.08](https://community.greenbone.net/t/gvm-20-08-stable-initial-release-2020-08-12/6312) | [20.08](https://community.greenbone.net/t/greenbone-os-20-08-0-released/6535) | gvmd 20.8 | 20.8 | 20.8 | 20.8 | 20.8| end-of-life (since 2021-12-02) | 2020-08-12 |

## My self-compiled version isn't working as expected. Can you help me?

All questions should be handled at the [community forum]
but please be aware that your questions are answered on a voluntary basis. Therefore,
please don't expect immediate responses. The community forum is for individuals
to exchange experiences and problems about a [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)
project and not to get instant advises from the developers or professional
support to fix your current issue.

If you are using a self-compiled version of the Greenbone software stack not build from this
guide or packages from an external third party like a distribution please always
check if you can reproduce the same behavior with the [Greenbone Enterprise TRIAL Virtual Machine](https://www.greenbone.net/en/testnow/)
If we are able to reproduce your issue it will be much easier to fix.

## Can I mix components from different releases?

Short answer: **no**. You must **never** mix versions of our components from
different releases. Often people try to use version e.g. the scanner from the
master branch in combination with a release version of the other components like
gvmd to check if their failing scan works with a newer version. While it may
work for some components in most circumstances it is very likely to break for
gvmd, ospd, ospd-openvas and openvas-scanner. These components interact with
each other a lot and rely on public and private interfaces that change with
**every** release. Internal incompatible changes even might happen in bugfix
releases. Therefore never mix components from different releases. Always use the
latest releases or the same release branches. In the release announcements of
the [community forum] we always update the linked released versions which should
be used and are known to work flawlessly.

## I am looking for an overview about OpenVAS

See {doc}`Greenbone, GVM, OpenVAS and How They Are Connected <history>` for some
background about Greenbone OpenVAS.

Our software consists of several software components. All components
are free software and can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/greenbone/).

For an overview of the components and their connections please take a look at
the {doc}`Architecture <architecture>`.
