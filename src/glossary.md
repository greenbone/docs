gvmd

  Management daemon shipped with GVM 10 and later. Abbreviation for
  **G**reenbone **V**ulnerability **M**anager **D**aemon.

openvassd

  Scanner daemon used by GVM 10 and before. It listens for incoming
  connections and starts scan processes to run the actual vulnerability tests.
  It collects the results and reports them to the management daemon. With the
  GVM 11 release, it has been converted to the {term}`openvas` application by
  removing the daemon and replacing the communication protocol.
  Abbreviation for **OpenVAS** **S**canner **D**aemon.

Greenbone Community Edition

  The Greenbone Community Edition covers the actual releases of the Greenbone
  application framework for vulnerability scanning and vulnerability
  management provided as open-source software to the community. The Greenbone
  Community Edition is adopted by external third parties, e.g., if the
  software framework is provided by a Linux distribution, it is build from the
  Greenbone Community Edition. It is developed as part of the commercial
  {term}`Greenbone Enterprise` product line. Sometimes referred to as the
  OpenVAS framework.

Greenbone Community Containers

  Container images that are pre-build on [GitHub](https://github.com/greenbone)
  and available via [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/greenbone). These
  images can be used to run the newest versions of the {term}`Greenbone Community Edition`
  without having to care about the operating system, compiler and build
  tool chains.

Greenbone Enterprise

  Greenbone Enterprise is the [Greenbone product line for on-premises solutions](https://www.greenbone.net/en/product-comparison/).
  Included are virtual or hardware Greenbone Enterprise Appliances with the

  the {term}`Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) framework <GVM>`, and
  the {term}`Greenbone Enterprise Feed`.

Greenbone Community Feed

  The [Greenbone Community Feed](https://www.greenbone.net/en/feed-comparison/)
  is the freely available feed for vulnerability information licensed as open-source.
  It contains basic scan configurations, report formats, port lists and the
  most important vulnerability tests. The provided data is updated on a daily
  basis with no warranty or promises for fixes or completeness.

Greenbone Enterprise Feed

  The [Greenbone Enterprise Feed](https://www.greenbone.net/en/feed-comparison/)
  is the commercial feed provided by Greenbone containing additional
  enterprise features like vulnerability tests for enterprise products, policy
  and compliance checks, extensive reports formats and special scan configurations.
  The feed comes with a service-level agreement ensuring support, quality
  assurance and availability.

VT

  Vulnerability Tests (VTs), also known as Network Vulnerability Tests
  (NVTs), are scripts written in the NASL programming language to detect
  vulnerabilities at remote hosts.

SCAP

  Abbreviation for [Security Content Automation Protocol](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol/).
  It is used for providing {term}`CPE` and {term}`CVE` data via the Greenbone
  Enterprise and Community Feeds.

CPE

  Abbreviation for [Common Platform Enumeration](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Security-Content-Automation-Protocol/Specifications/cpe).
  Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) is a standardized method of describing and
  identifying classes of applications, operating systems, and hardware devices
  present among an enterprise's computing assets.

CVE

  Abbreviation for [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://www.cve.org/).
  It provides unique, common identifiers for publicly known information-security
  vulnerabilities in publicly released software packages.

notus-scanner

  A new scanner that got introduced in the 22.4 release to improve the so-called
  local security checks. Local security checks are comparisons of
  vulnerable and installed versions of a software. Before notus-scanner, all
  checks have been implemented in nasl scripts and each nasl script ran in an
  own openvas-scanner process. With notus-scanner, checks are run in one go per
  host.

Feed

  The feed is a set of different files continuously delivered via
  {command}`rsync` and updated on a daily basis. It contains {term}`CPE`,
  {term}`CVE`, {term}`VT`, CERT, Port List, Report Format and Scan Config
  information. The feed is available in a {term}`Commercial<Greenbone Enterprise Feed>`
  and {term}`Community<Greenbone Community Feed>` edition.
