Greenbone Community – Documentation
===================================

The Greenbone Community Edition covers the actual source code of the Greenbone
OpenVAS stack.

It is available as regularly updated source code snapshots/release archives
confirmed to work and as source code checkouts directly from the git source code
management (SCM) system. The latter is not recommended for production scenarios
as the code is edited on a daily basis and issues and incomplete functionality
may appear.

The sources of the Greenbone Community Edition is adopted by third parties, for
example Linux distributions like Kali, Alpine, etc.

Edition
