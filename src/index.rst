Greenbone Community Edition â€“ Documentation
===========================================

The Greenbone Community Edition covers the actual source code of the `Greenbone
OpenVAS <https://www.openvas.org/>`_ stack.

It is available as regularly updated source code snapshots/release archives
confirmed to work and as source code checkouts directly from the git source code
repositories at `GitHub <https://github.com/greenbone/>`_. The latter is not
recommended for production scenarios as the code is edited on a daily basis and
issues and incomplete functionality may appear.

The sources of the Greenbone Community Edition are adopted by third parties, for
example Linux distributions like Kali, Alpine, etc.

This documentation covers the stable (22.4) version of the Greenbone Community
Edition.
